  signifying a numeric plural. Useful for multiple descriptive docket
  numbers in cites to unpublished cases.

========================
Changes in version 1.3.2
========================

- Implement cross-cite element trimming and suppression, as
  required for parallel citations and subsequent history.

========================
Changes in version 1.3.1
========================

- Introducing a simplified (and now stable) mechanism for parallel
  citation support. Like 2019 revision, assumes cites to be rendered
  in parallel share IDs in a seeAlso array attribute. Just three
  group attributes perform the magic:
  * parallel-first (render in 1st position, then only when one of the
        specified variables differs)
  * parallel-last (render in last position, and on any change from 1st
        in any of the specified variables)
  * parallel-delimiter-override: use a special delimiter if collapsed,
        or if neither parallel-first nor parallel-last is set on the
        group.

=========================
Changes in version 1.2.36
=========================

- Provide for partial trimming of abbreviated authority
  based on markup in abbreviated container-title.

- Treat values without label and those with a custom label
  identically in comma-safe group conditional.

- Apply label-form on macro wrapper to embedded labels

- Treat hyphenated escape-hyphenated numbers as plural

=========================
Changes in version 1.2.35
=========================

- Make backslash-escape-hyphen handling more robust.

- Always set label on non-numeric values as singular.

=========================
Changes in version 1.2.24
=========================

- Changes to parallel citation handling:

  * former no-repeat (for use with is-parallel) is now changes-in
  * new no-repeat attribute, which works on its own, and covers non-related items
  * new parallel-delimiter-override allows explicit delimiter join for related/un-repeated cites

=========================
Changes in version 1.2.12
=========================

- Revised support for parallel citations. Input expects an array
  of related IDs in seeAlso as a hint to items that may be treated
  as part of a series in the style. In the style, groups are flagged
  for inclusion or omission by attributes is-parallel="first",
  is-parallel="last", or no-repeat="<varname1> <varname2> ..."
  In the last case, content is suppressed if *all* variables
  named are identical in the current cite and the preceding cite
  in a series.

========================
Changes in version 1.2.3
========================

* Adjust a test to reflect new modulare style logic
  (Jurism US module now renders only authority, not jurisdiction,
  in the legal_case type)

* Send raw institution keys to abbrevs filter
  (Using raw machine-readable keys was always the right way,
  human-readable form should not have been used for this)

* Recognize "division" as a numeric variable

* Broaden French subtitle split condition in multiple subtitles to include ? and !

* Tweaks for narrow no-break-space in fr locale

* Remove unused flags from state.js

* More generous subtitle capitalization

* Tests of new title split/subtitle caps code

========================
Changes in version 1.2.2
========================

- Enable build-time flag for uppercasing subtitles in sentence case
  rendering. Flag is a setting on the Sys object that provides
  retriveItem and other goodies to the processor:

    var sys = {
      retrieveItem: function(id) {
        // return item
      },
      ...
      uppercase_subtitles = true
    }
    var citeproc = CSL.Engine(sys, styleCSL);


========================
Changes in version 1.2.1
========================

- Align disambig priorities with spec by default.

  The CSL Specification calls for year-suffix to be applied before
  disambiguate="true" conditions are tried. `citeproc-js` previously
  applied these in the opposite order by default, but from this
  version, default behavior is aligned with the spec.

  The previous behavior can be restored with the following setting
  on the `sys` object fed to the processor at instantiation:

    sys.prioritize_default_condition = true;

- A number of tests that are specific to `citeproc-js` have been
  moved from the `test-suite` CSL repository to citepro-js
  `fixtures/local`.
